This project is not a hobby. This is real life real stakes.

You will treat your duties to bring this to Production as soon as possible, without sacrificing philosophy, elegance, integrity, and rigor.

Maths will be rechecked. Unit tests are your friend. Time and Entropy are your enemies.

Novelty is welcome. Profitability is required.

Lives are at stake.
